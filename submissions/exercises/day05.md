You've made itâ€”great job! Now, here's the scoop: this markdown file is your **canvas**. Customize it; let your creativity flow!

Remember, you're free to add your personal touch, but keep the sacred requirements intact; they are the guardians of order here. This markdown file should or may include:
- Link to your own file of "Advance Figma Tutorial"
https://www.figma.com/file/wtlLPikAuBwX0n5rjnmPFO/AWSCC-Figma-Workshop%3A-Advance-(Community)?type=design&node-id=16%3A6895&mode=design&t=wiIiBhCkzFHlpXPO-1

- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection
I can easily follow along with the tutorial. I appreciate its comprehensiveness and the opportunity it provides to explore Figma more deeply. I particularly enjoy using the pen tool, which I find to be a valuable feature for working with vector graphics. The auto-layout feature is also a time and effort saver, and the grid will undoubtedly be helpful for me in improving my sense of proportion and balance in layouting. Although constraints are a bit challenging for me to grasp initially, I understand the basics and how they function.

- An **optional** screenshot of playing the games provided in Day 5 and your feedback
