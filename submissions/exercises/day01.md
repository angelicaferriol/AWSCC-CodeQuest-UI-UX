#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee has better organization of its products because the categories are more generalized. It also provides flash deals, new arrivals, and top products. I have used both of these online shops, and yet Shopee offers more personalized suggestions based on my previous orders and searches, making it easier for me to find the product I want. In contrast, Lazada sometimes recommends irrelevant products.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: In Shopee, the only potential distraction I find is the random pop-up game, particularly the 'spin the wheel' feature, which offers rewards like vouchers and coins on the homepage. It can be distracting to see it moving on the side. Conversely, Lazada has an unnecessary and redundant layout for categories. The first one is the list type at the top, along with second category-- the tiles/cubes displaying images with title in front. I believe the initial category list should be removed, as it is barely noticeable and adds an unnecessary element to the homepage.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee has better organization of content, as indicated by the features mentioned above on the homepage, providing an easy user experience on the search page, and offering a more relevant profile page that easily tracks what's in your cart and your previous transactions. I believe this is also attributed to the eye-pleasing interface, particularly the vibrant colors that reflect its branding.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Yes, especially in the case of Shopee, where the color orange is now ingrained and reflected in various elements of the website's layout. 
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Both websites have excellent responsiveness and smooth performance.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: As mmentioned in the final point of the User Experience Analysis, Shopee stands out with superior visual elements. This is attributed not only to the harmonious integration of its features but also to the eye-pleasing color scheme that aligns well with its branding.
