- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection:
I couldn't find the Figma Basics Tutorial because I created my Figma account a few months ago, and I guess I might have deleted that file/project. Regardless, I still wanted to explore Figma on my own, so I created my first-ever design. I started with the simple task of redesigning the homepage of Spotify, which I found really enjoyable because I'm getting comfortable with how easy it is to use Figma while adding a touch of creativity. It took me almost 4 hours to finish my first design because I was busy exploring every tools and features. I'm looking forward to create more activities and projects!
