You've made itâ€”great job! Now, here's the scoop: this markdown file is your **canvas**. Customize it; let your creativity flow!

Remember, you're free to add your personal touch, but keep the sacred requirements intact; they are the guardians of order here. This markdown file should include:

- Link to your own file of **"Figma Basics Tutorial"**: https://www.figma.com/file/qOdgJvvLzk010CYSFH4dDA/AWSCC-Figma-Workshop%3A-Basics-(Community)?type=design&node-id=5%3A2590&mode=design&t=KN3F94p4t4I048ql-1

- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection: To be honest, I struggled looking for the canvas that I will create the activity, hence I couldn't start this quest right away. I didn't know that it was just right below. But the overall experience of using Figma is fantastic. The features are easy to use and the instructions of the tutorial is easy to follow.

Ready to include your output for **Day 2**? Let the customization begin! ðŸš€âœ¨
